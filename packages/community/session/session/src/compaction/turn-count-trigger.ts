/**
 * Triggers compaction when the session exceeds a maximum number of _turns_.

 * tool calls, tool results) up to the next user message. Counting turns is more
 * semantically meaningful than counting raw messages because it represents complete
 * user↔agent exchanges and ensures compaction never fires in the middle of a multi-step
 * tool interaction.
 *
 * Pair with {@link TurnWindowCompactionStrategy} or
 * {@link RecursiveSummarizationCompactionStrategy} to keep the threshold and the
 * compaction unit consistent.
